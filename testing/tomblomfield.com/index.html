      <h3><span>When to join a startup</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p>Something has changed in the last few years which has made an increasing number of people want to join startups. It seemed to start around the time the Social Network movie came out - perhaps it&rsquo;s just a coincidence, but part of me imagines a group of MBAs sitting around watching Justin Timberlake play Sean Parker, thinking that <i>actually</i> a billion dollars <i>would be pretty cool</i>.</p><p>When choosing a startup to work at, people often overlook one of the most important factors, which is the <i>size and stage</i>&nbsp;of the company. I&rsquo;d argue this is sometimes even more important than the industry or the idea itself.<br></p><p><b>Bootstrapping, aka two people in a bedroom</b></p><p>The startup was recently formed, and the company might not even be legally incorporated yet. There&rsquo;s no funding and no-one is taking any salary. You&rsquo;re two, three or four people in a bedroom living on baked beans, working all hours of the day to get a working prototype to show to customers or investors. The only people using your website or app are a couple of sympathetic friends and your mum.</p><p>Someone else tried to convince you to join a different startup a year earlier, but they had no funding and zero customers. They wanted you to work without a salary in return for 1% of equity, which sounded like a scam to you. You&rsquo;re glad you picked this startup instead. You might not be getting any salary, but at least you&rsquo;re joining as a co-founder with a double-digit equity stake. You jokingly talk with your cofounders about which island you&rsquo;d each buy when you sell out for billions in a few years&rsquo; time.</p><p>The product vision is vague and broad, but you&rsquo;re working every day to try to validate it with customers. Anything is possible. The entire direction of the company might even be changing from week to week.</p><p>Because nothing yet exists, you need to bring it to life with a combination of energy and raw self-belief. There&rsquo;s little specialisation and no hierarchy; everyone does whatever needs to be done. It can be exhilarating.</p><p>It can also be exhausting at times, lasting months or years before you find customer traction or funding.<br></p><p><b>Seed-Funded</b></p><p>Now the company has a working prototype, a few dozen regular users and &pound;250k of seed funding. It&rsquo;s enough to pay a handful of people low salaries. Since you&rsquo;re too big to fit in a bedroom, you&rsquo;re renting desks at a coworking space or scrounging them off a bigger startup.</p><p>You cut a lot of corners, but seem to ship an incredible amount of code. People you don&rsquo;t know personally start to use your product and it feels awesome. You&rsquo;re working hard to spread the word, perhaps even starting to earn a little revenue from your first paying users. </p><p>You join at this stage for 3% equity plus whatever basic salary you need to survive. You talk about which cities you&rsquo;d buy houses in when the company sells.</p><p>You might join as the first professional programmer or designer, but you&rsquo;re still more-or-less on your own. When you join, your first job is to go to the Apple Store and buy yourself a laptop because no-one thought to order any equipment. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;mentorship&rdquo; from more experienced colleagues or even code-review, simply because the company is still too small. </p><p>&ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; consists of one of the founders emailing your funding announcement to TechCrunch </p><p>As an employee, you have a significant say in the direction of the company, although the business model might still shift substantially underneath you. Even if you&rsquo;re not making the decisions, you hear about them immediately.</p><p>There&rsquo;s still a good chance that the company fails to find &ldquo;product-market fit&rdquo; and goes bankrupt without raising more money. Your mum tells you that you should have stuck with your well-paying job at Oracle.</p><p><b>Series A</b></p><p>The company has raised &pound;3m from a big-name VC and the team has grown to 10-15 people. You&rsquo;ve got your own office with your logo on the door, or at least your own area in the coworking space.</p><p>The investor makes you submit quarterly cashflow reports, so you start keeping accounts for the first time. This is done by whoever has Excel installed on their computer.<br>The company eventually hires an office manager to ease the burden of administration on the founders. They set up a payroll provider and start doing peer reviews.</p><p>You join the company to do a specific role, but you spend your first week or two figuring out what you should actually be working on. At least they remembered to buy you a laptop, a desk and a chair.</p><p>There are 3 or 4 engineers in the team, so you start to do code-review and set up a continuous integration server. You lament all the technical debt that was accrued by those idiots who arrived before you, slowing down the pace of feature development.</p><p>A new product direction for the company is decided in a meeting of the three founders; this is presented in an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting of 12 employees. The company sets out a quarterly product roadmap, and you&rsquo;re asked what you think should be prioritised. You pick the projects that most interest you.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll certainly be able to earn more money at a big company, but the salaries are enough to live comfortably on. You get 0.5% in stock options with a salary that&rsquo;s 10-30% below market rate. But you reckon it&rsquo;s worth the gamble - if the company sells, you&rsquo;ll be able to buy a really nice house in London. Still, it feels a long way off.</p><p>The marketing function is one full-time person who does everything from PR, paid advertising and social media. The founder no longer personally runs the company&rsquo;s Twitter account. Your company regularly appears in the &ldquo;ones to watch&rdquo; articles in tech press.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve got thousands of paying customers, and you occasionally see people in public using your app, which feels fantastic. Your mum isn&rsquo;t really sure what your company does, but she&rsquo;s happy enough because you&rsquo;re being paid a real salary.</p><p><b>Series B</b></p><p>The company is now 2-3 years old and has just raised &pound;10-20m. It&rsquo;s using that money to grow the team, increasing headcount to 60 people.</p><p>The founders got tired of the dingy office, so they splashed out on somewhere with lots of exposed brickwork and glass walls. Everyone is sitting on Herman Miller chairs. You find these chairs online and see they cost &pound;1000 each.</p><p>There are 3 or 4 people in finance and HR roles, and you&rsquo;re presented with a company handbook when you join. You have a couple of days&rsquo; training, but you mostly figure it out along the way.</p><p>Marketing now has three digital advertising people, and people specialising in PR, content and community management. You&rsquo;ve got millions of paying customers in several countries, and your company is regularly featured in the business pages of the press. </p><p>Engineering has been split into two or three separate teams, and they&rsquo;re trying recruit graduating college students to fill the hiring pipeline for next year.</p><p>You join in a very well-defined role, after the team manager recruited you. You meet founders during your interview, but they don&rsquo;t always remember your name now you work here. The CEO sees a management coach every fortnight.</p><p>A new product direction is debated at a board meeting, and senior management is informed by the CEO. Management let their teams know that changes are imminent. Most people are focussed on &ldquo;repeatable processes&rdquo; and scaling up. </p><p>The company doesn&rsquo;t seem to release new features very often, but the app is used by some of of your mum&rsquo;s friends, which makes her very proud. </p><p>Your salary is in line with what other companies are paying, and you get 0.05% stock options. You&rsquo;ve already figured out which house you&rsquo;d put a deposit on when the company sells. A sale seems inevitable at some stage.</p><p><b>Series C</b></p><p>You&rsquo;re joining a unicorn! After 5 years, the company has raised &pound;100m at a &pound;1bn valuation. There are some strange terms in the deal structure that you&rsquo;ve never seen before, but the company&rsquo;s HR department tells you that&rsquo;s just &ldquo;legal stuff&rdquo;. </p><p>When you join, you&rsquo;re granted &pound;50,000 of options, which you work out is one two-hundredth of a percent, or 0.005% of the company. Friends in other startups tell you to check what the investor&rsquo;s liquidation preference is, but no-one at the company can seem tell you. They&rsquo;re all too busy trying to guess when the IPO is going to be announced. You figure that any kind of payout is a nice bonus. The salary is pretty decent anyway.</p><p>You join in the company&rsquo;s newly opened Dublin office, part of a new drive by the company to internationalise. You&rsquo;ve joined as one of 6 new Sales Associates focussing on European enterprise sales. There&rsquo;s 4 week intensive induction training programme before you&rsquo;re allowed to talk to any customers.</p><p>The new office feels empty at first, but you&rsquo;re surprised how quickly it fills up with new staff. You ask where the marketing department sit, but you&rsquo;re told they&rsquo;re in a different office.</p><p>You see the CEO on the cover of Forbes, but you&rsquo;ve never actually met him.</p><p>Your mum is already using the app, although it&rsquo;s starting to look a bit dated compared to some of the newer startups that are in TechCrunch.</p><p>Business Insider reports that the company has fired the new VP of Product and is pursuing a new production direction. She had only arrived from Twitter 6 months earlier. An internal memo from HR a couple of days says that the company&rsquo;s doing some minor internal restructuring.</p><p>You see consultants in the meeting rooms, but you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p><p>A month later, you gather for a televised all-hands meeting, broadcast from the company&rsquo;s HQ. The CEO delivers a short speech announcing that the company&rsquo;s been acquired by Oracle, explaining how it will accelerate the company&rsquo;s ability to deliver on its vision. He thanks everyone for being part of the company&rsquo;s incredible journey. People in the audience are crying.</p><p>HR follows up explaining that as part of the acquisition, some departments will be downsized. You&rsquo;re told that your stock options are &ldquo;underwater&rdquo;. When you Google this, you &nbsp;find out that they&rsquo;re worthless. You&rsquo;ve got some friends in engineering who are being given Oracle stock as a &ldquo;retention package&rdquo;, but that doesn&rsquo;t apply to anyone in sales. You wonder why you ever joined a startup in the first place.<br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D10900462&amp;t=MDJmYzgxZjhiYmE2YTI2NDA2NzQzMTFjNmM1ODcxMDhhMTE0MTQ5NixGYURLczdPSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F136759441870%2Fwhen-to-join-a-startup&amp;m=1">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a></p></div>

      <h3><span>Five Unbreakable Rules for Startups</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p>

I&rsquo;ve been involved with 4 startups over the last 10 years or so, 3 as a co-founder. I&rsquo;m a follower of <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fpaulgraham.com%2Farticles.html&amp;t=ODQzOWU3NjU1NDU3MTQyMDlhNjE1ZDE2MzFkYzAyMjIwNGZhZDk5MixvR0R2NUY1TA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F135120600360%2Ffive-unbreakable-rules-for-startups&amp;m=1">Paul Graham and the YC camp of startup wisdom</a>. There&rsquo;s now a great deal of literature laying out the unbreakable rules for startups. Despite studying this literature, I&rsquo;ve managed to break each of these rules, in some cases more than once. In every case, I have come to regret it.&nbsp;</p><p><b>1. Choose your cofounders carefully</b></p><p>If your startup is successful, you&rsquo;ll spend the majority of your waking time with these people for the next 5 years. Invest the right amount of time getting to know each other. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll have worked with these people for a few years at another company before you do your own thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Your relationship will be like a marriage, but even more intense.</p><p>Three co-founders feels like the right number. Try to find the most driven, effective people you know and convince them to join you. Unless there&rsquo;s a really good reason, equity splits should be equal. If you don&rsquo;t think your cofounders as effective or valuable as you, why are you starting a company with them?&nbsp;</p><p><b>2. Written agreements from the start</b></p><p>An agreement doesn&rsquo;t have to be complex, or necessarily involve lawyers. There are plenty of open-source co-founder agreements published by law firms. But you need to agree:&nbsp;</p><p>a) Any money invested, either as equity or debt
<br>b) Equity split
<br>c) Salaries, included any deferred compensation&nbsp;</p><p>In the simplest case, the agreement will be &ldquo;no money invested, equal equity splits, zero salary&rdquo;. But as soon as bills need paying, things get trickier. An investor friend recently told me that he makes a rule of telling founders, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you to trust me&rdquo;. All deals go into writing immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. All stock must be on a vesting schedule</b></p><p>Vesting means that stock is earned over the lifetime of a person&rsquo;s involvement at a company. A standard vesting schedule is &ldquo;4 year vesting with a 1 year cliff&rdquo;. This means, if I have 48 shares in a company, 12 of those become irrevocably mine (i.e. &ldquo;vest&rdquo;) on the first anniversary of my joining the company. The remaining 36 shares vest monthly over the remaining 3 years - 1 share per month.&nbsp;</p><p>If I leave (or I&rsquo;m fired) after 3 years, I walk away with 36 shares. The remaining 12 shares are taken back by the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Vesting is a good thing for everyone. It ties people&rsquo;s incentives to the long-term success of the company. I&rsquo;ve heard founders even talking about 6 or 8 year vesting sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>If your co-founder says &ldquo;just trust me&rdquo;, see above.<b><br></b><b><br></b><b>4. Keep company money separate</b></p><p>When your company needs to pay bills and you&rsquo;ve not raised outside investment yet, be very clear who&rsquo;s paying and under what terms. Is the money going to be repaid? When?&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as you can, establish a separate company bank account. All cofounders ideally put the same amount of cash in, and bills get paid out from that account. Simple.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re putting in money as a stop-gap before an investment round and expect the money to be repaid, put this in writing. It should appear in your company&rsquo;s balance sheet as a liability - &ldquo;Director Loan&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll also need to let investors know if you expect to use their investment to pay back loans.
<br><br><b>5. When you go out to raise investment, don&rsquo;t over-optimise for valuation.</b></p><p>PG stood up one Tuesday evening at Y Combinator with a memorable lesson. YC companies are competitive about everything. In each new batch, founders are told not to compete over who can raise at the highest valuation. And every batch, some founders ignore this advice. Airbnb, we were told, raised their seed round of $600k on a valuation of something like $3.5m - certainly nothing like the uncapped convertible notes we sometimes see at the moment. And the Airbnb founders are just fine with how they&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp;</p><p>You should spend a little time figuring out what price the market will offer. Choose the investors you think you could work with for next 5-10 years. Don&rsquo;t spend time shopping the deal around to increase your valuation. Also, don&rsquo;t pick crappy investors just because they offer a higher valuation.&nbsp;</p><p><b>These rules are not negotiable!</b></p><p>If you break them, you will end up in trouble.

      <h3><span>Getting Shit Done</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p>

I was recently talking to a handful of successful startups founders about issues they were facing as they scaled up their companies. Unanimously, hiring and retaining people who &ldquo;get shit done&rdquo; seemed to be their biggest problem. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for the last few days, because it&rsquo;s a deceptively simple idea. &nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s deceptively simple because people have a very strong cognitive bias - practically everyone thinks they &ldquo;get shit done&rdquo;, much like everyone thinks they are an <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIllusory_superiority&amp;t=OWNmZmNiNjg5ZDY3M2IzZmYyMjdmNjgxNjE1NjU4MmYwMjA1N2Q1Niw1cE0wM1B1Sw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F132810390155%2Fgetting-shit-done&amp;m=1">above-average driver</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Empirically, most people do <i>not</i> get shit done.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So what does "getting shit done&rdquo; look like? How can you define it?<br></p><p>The closest I&rsquo;ve come is someone who, when confronted with a problem, will fix it with a surprisingly good solution in a surprisingly short amount of time. They have an ability to produce an astonishingly high quantity <i>and</i> quality of work. It&rsquo;s someone I am confident giving my hardest, ugliest problems to, knowing that they&rsquo;ll solve it better than I could. And when they present the solution, you&rsquo;ll see they found a bunch of other problems along the way and fixed them too.</p><p>These are the kind of people you should try to start companies with. If you&rsquo;re already running a startup, they are your most valuable assets. Give them more equity than your board is comfortable with, and try to get them to stick around as long as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Paul Graham&rsquo;s formulation, they are &ldquo;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Frelres.html&amp;t=OWE2MTQzYmY0YTM0OTFjNjRiMjc2ZTNhODI4NjBhZmE0NWQzMjY4ZCw1cE0wM1B1Sw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F132810390155%2Fgetting-shit-done&amp;m=1">relentlessly resourceful</a>&rdquo;. Somehow, they just seem to defeat any problem. There are many different strategies. You can plough through an obstacle with brute force applied in just the right place. Or you can avoid the obstacle by redefining the problem, changing the rules of the game to suit yourself. Perhaps simply refusing to give up, and working harder and longer than anyone would consider reasonable. And sometimes doing things that look a little crazy from the outside.</p><p>The opposite is uncomfortably common. There are many people who will talk about problems, strategise different solutions, seek input and group consensus, but never actually accomplish anything. When things don&rsquo;t happen, they always have a list of reasons why it&rsquo;s not their fault. In a startup, this person needs weeding out as quickly as possible because they&rsquo;re dead weight.</p><p>Once a company is running, it can gain a momentum all of its own. This seems especially true for big companies with a stable customer-base and market share. Some large companies have such momentum that a large proportion of the employees could simply not come to work and the thing would keep going all by itself. Big companies seem to train managers to be &ldquo;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhorowitz.com%2Fwhy_is_it_hard_to_bring_big_company_execs_into_little_companies&amp;t=MmE3OTg3ZTkyM2UxY2FiYjYxM2JmZjViYmE0NDBiMDcxM2U2MzhmYSw1cE0wM1B1Sw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F132810390155%2Fgetting-shit-done&amp;m=1">interrupt-driven</a>&rdquo;, rather than proactive. So if you&rsquo;re hiring from big companies, watch out for this.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Consistently &ldquo;getting shit done&rdquo; takes a huge amount of energy and initiative, but it seems energising for the right kind of person, rather than exhausting. It is a particularly important skill in the early days, because the natural state of a startup is inertia and, ultimately, failure. At first, your company has zero velocity, so you need to apply an incredible amount of time and energy to overcome this inertia and get the thing moving. &nbsp;Nothing happens unless you make it happen.</p><p>My favourite example is the story of Instacart&rsquo;s early launch with Trader Joe&rsquo;s. Instacart is a grocery delivery service and partners with some of the biggest retailers in the world. But when they were starting out, they wanted all of the inventory of Trader Joe&rsquo;s listed on their site, along with the price and photo for each item. A normal approach would have been to negotiate a business development deal, which would have taken many months, killing momentum. Instead, the founders figured out that they could probably purchase <i>one of every single item</i> in the store, and working for 48 hours straight, photograph it all in a studio that was empty over a weekend. In my book, <i>that</i> is getting shit done.&nbsp;</p></div>

      <h3><span>Apple is propping up a fundamentally broken payments industry</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p class="p1"><span>Apple&rsquo;s latest announcement on payments has sparked some interesting debate but also a fair share of breathless pronouncements on a &ldquo;revolution" in mobile payments.</span></p><p class="p1">To be clear - Apple Pay is a step forward in terms of end user experience - but it simply entrenches a fundamentally broken card payment network and layers on even more cost.</p><p class="p1">Apple have long been masters of user experience - and Apple Pay does makes significant strides forward in that area. The point-of-sale experience is good, but not much better than contactless cards that have been common in Europe for years. The real leap forwards is in-app payments - new apps installed on an iPhone will have access to payment details without the user having to type in card details for every new purchase. Instead, customers will be prompted to scan a fingerprint, and the payment will be processed - that&rsquo;s a pretty big leap forward in terms of experience.</p><p class="p1">There&rsquo;s been speculation that this new payment mechanism might lead to the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fa16z.com%2F2014%2F09%2F09%2Fa16z-podcast-apple-takes-on-payments-and-your-wrist%2F%2520&amp;t=OTQwZTJmNzJiZDA2MjIyOTQzNDQ5M2VlODE0ODQyNjQxNTRjYTI5NyxURGF5WE5Teg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F97304410500%2Fapple-is-propping-up-a-fundamentally-broken&amp;m=1">virtualization of credit cards</a>. But what does that really mean? Apple is not killing the credit card. They&rsquo;re killing the little piece of plastic that gets sent in the mail. Again, a big user experience improvement, but a trivial improvement at the payments level - payments are still going across the card networks. Fundamentally, having to switch out a card to access a different credit product seems wrong-headed.</p><p class="p1">All this talk of &ldquo;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdanielbower.com%2Fpost%2F97211428585%2Ffrictionless-credit-cards&amp;t=ZDk1MGM5N2UwZTM0ZjdlYmI2YTQxZjRmZTRmYjFhMGM4ODczYmQ3MixURGF5WE5Teg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F97304410500%2Fapple-is-propping-up-a-fundamentally-broken&amp;m=1">frictionless credit cards</a>&rdquo; presupposes that cards and card networks are necessary in the first place. Perhaps a more interesting question is "frictionless credit&rdquo;.</p><p class="p1">To understand how this might work, we need to break down a payment transaction to see where credit fits in:</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">A customer presents a card to merchant for payment, perhaps entering a PIN in a terminal.</li><li class="li3">The terminal&nbsp;sends transaction details up a line from the merchant to a payment processor.</li><li class="li3">The processor forwards transaction details to the card company&rsquo;s network.</li><li class="li3">The card company routes transaction details to card issuer (the customer&rsquo;s bank, or an independent financing company) for authorization. Is there credit available? Ie, is customer within agreed balance or overdraft limits?</li><li class="li3">Issuer approves transaction and sends confirmation back through same channels.</li><li class="li3">The customer gets their item from the shop and leaves.</li></ul><p class="p1">The &ldquo;credit&rdquo; in credit card is not related to the plastic card, or even the card network. It&rsquo;s simply debt financing that&rsquo;s offered by a financial institution at the other end of a series of pipes. Visa &amp; co provide those pipes, but charge a pretty heft fee for doing so. Thanks to the existing 4-party system, merchants are paying around 2-3% of every transaction as a tax levied by those incumbents, who add little value in return. Apple now makes that a 5-party system, adding extra cost in exchange for a slick user experience.</p><p class="p1">With Apple Pay, instead of a user inserting a card and entering a pin, they&rsquo;d present their iPhone and touch their thumb to a fingerprint reader. Their iPhone passes up credit card details via the card processor (or, more precisely, it passes up a token that allows the card networks to access card details from Apple&rsquo;s servers a little way down the line), and the process continues as normal. The metaphor of Apple Pay as a simple &ldquo;wallet&rdquo; works well - it simply provides a mechanism for storing your cards, and presenting them to merchants when you want to pay. They aren&rsquo;t actually processing any payments themselves., unlike PayPal or Google Wallet.</p><p class="p3">Apple Pay entrenches a fundamentally broken card payment network, and layers on even more cost. Apple has struck deals with Payment Networks and Issuing banks, and as part of those deals, it is taking a cut of the fee. It&rsquo;s now another mouth to feed.</p><p class="p3">What we should be aiming at is frictionless payment over a different series of pipes - the public internet, and existing inter-bank electronic clearing systems. If Banks opened up their platforms to allow multiple credit providers, we&rsquo;d have competition to offer consumers credit financing on competitive terms. Whether you need an overdraft, a fixed-term loan or individual-item financing, you should get the best rate available in the market. The idea of having to switch payment card to get access to the best rates is crazy.</p><p class="p3">By decoupling the issue of&nbsp;&ldquo;credit&rdquo;&nbsp;is from "payment network&rdquo;, we expose the card networks for the rent-seeking oligopoly they are.</p><p><a href="http://tomblomfield.com/post/97304410500/apple-is-propping-up-a-fundamentally-broken-payments">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a></p></div>

      <h3><span>Customer churn can kill your startup</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p class="p1"><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Fgrowth.html&amp;t=MDM5ZWZmMWMxNDljZWEyNTIzZWFmYjJlZjYxZWFmNjFhYWM2NDQ1MSxPNkVtNVN4cQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F81105143223%2Fcustomer-churn-can-kill-your-startup&amp;m=1">Startups are about growth</a>,&nbsp;and of all the different possible metrics, startups often focus on user growth -&nbsp;if people aren&rsquo;t using your new product or service in greater and greater numbers, it&rsquo;s a good sign that you&rsquo;re not on the right track. And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth.</p><p class="p1">But there&rsquo;s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).</p><p class="p2">In the early days, it&rsquo;s very hard to measure your churn because you simply haven&rsquo;t been around long enough. The early revenue growth curves for high- and low-churn companies may look identical.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">In fact, high-churn businesses often have exceptionally impressive growth numbers in their first months or years because they&rsquo;ve found some viral loop, the crack cocaine of startup-land, which provides an explosive catalyst for new-user acquisition.</p><p class="p1">However, problems often start to appear after the first year or so - occasional weak months look exceptionally bad, since your business model relies on new customers in the top of the funnel to replace those flooding out. And even if you manage to keep finding new people to push into the top of your funnel for several years, you will eventually churn through your entire addressable market.</p><p class="p1">Then your business implodes.</p><p class="p1">The prime examples are Zynga and Groupon - both of which have been catastrophically failing over the last year or two.</p><p class="p2">Conversely, low-churn businesses often have relatively modest initial user-acquisition growth curves. Often, the nature of low-churn businesses (in particular, high switching costs) makes it incredibly hard to gain your first few users before you&rsquo;ve established credibility. However, these same hurdles present considerable long-term advantages, and the occasional slow month in terms of user-acquisition still increases monthly revenue. Once you&rsquo;ve built up a loyal customer base, it becomes an extremely attractive business model - costs are often fixed &amp; up-front, and the marginal cost to serve each customer every month is minimal.</p><p class="p2">When talking to startups, my favourite graph to look at is their revenue by monthly cohort. That is, splitting each months&rsquo; revenue by the month in which the users originally signed up to the service.</p><p class="p2">In a low-churn business, the graph looks like a layer-cake, with each new month of users adding a layer of revenue on the top of the business.</p><p class="p2"><img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/b85a6d5d56c36b155d13ac7d2684d98a/tumblr_inline_n37sy2AZA91r5tr1m.png"></p><p>The thin cohorts at the bottom of the graph are the loyal users who signed up at the start, and who are still paying for your service 18 months later. The orange tip in the top-right are the users who just signed up, and have only contributed to revenue in month 18.</p><p class="p2">In the best low-churn businesses, the revenue provided by each cohort can actually&nbsp;<em><strong>grow</strong> </em>over time - each cohort gets &ldquo;fatter&rdquo; - if you can successfully up-sell new services.</p><p class="p2">In a high-churn business, the cohorts decay alarmingly quickly, and once new-user acquisition starts to slow, the business implodes.</p><p class="p2"><img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/76dea195e0390191ceeefba0effbdce9/tumblr_inline_n37sxtY37t1r5tr1m.png"></p><p><span>If you simply looked at the top-line of the graph (total monthly revenue), without considering the cohorts, you&rsquo;d think the high-churn business was doing much better until at least month 13-14. But one-and-a-half years in, it&rsquo;s clear that the low-churn business is on a path to success, while the high-churn business needs to execute a substantial pivot to avoid failure.</span></p><p class="p2"><span><strong>Indicators of Churn</strong></span></p><p class="p2">So what are the characteristics of high- and low-churn businesses, and what techniques can you use to minimise churn?</p><p class="p2"><span><strong>High Switching</strong><strong> Costs</strong></span> - if it&rsquo;s slow, painful &amp; costly to switch providers, you will experience very low customer churn. This is clearly the case with retail banks, email providers and recurring payment processors. I still bank with the same provider I chose 15 years ago, despite their crappy service and barely-functional website.</p><p class="p2">New competitors have developed clever tactics to solve this problem - developing onboarding tools to reduce switching costs, or focussing on new customers before they&rsquo;ve committed to an incumbent provider. This is one reason Stripe focusses so hard on serving other startups, and banks target teenagers.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Sales Architecture</strong>&nbsp;- the way a product is priced &amp; sold is often designed to minimise churn. Gyms &amp; dating sites are the best examples here. People come out of the Christmas &amp; New Year vacation period feeling unhealthy, lonely, and determined to change. One large dating site books over 70% of its annual revenue in the first quarter of the year.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><strong>Strong Brand Loyalty / Personality</strong><span>&nbsp;- the best brands position themselves as expressions of their customers&rsquo; personality.</span></p><p class="p2">Cigarette companies and beverage manufacturers are the best example of this - products are often indistinguishable from each other, and the switching costs are minimal. The customer can just reach for a different can on the shelf. Companies combat this by investing heavily in marketing to position their products in customers&rsquo; mind as extensions of themselves.</p><p class="p2">There&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon in the drinks industry where a couple of faceless mega-corps control a wide variety of incredibly powerful brands with basically indistinguishable underlying products - MillerCoors and Anheuser Busch.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><span><strong>&nbsp;<br><span>Make Something People Love</span></strong>&nbsp;- after&nbsp;</span>some fantastic comments from readers, I&rsquo;ve added this extra point. Perhaps the most difficult, but also most effective form of customer retention is making a product or service that is dramatically superior to the competition. As Barry put it, &ldquo;<span>The switching cost is missing out on a great service.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s subtly different from brand loyalty - Google has very low churn because its search engine is so much better than the competition. It arguably doesn&rsquo;t have a very strong brand or &ldquo;personality&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="p2"><span><strong>So What?</strong></span></p><p class="p2">To some extent, you&rsquo;re stuck with the churn inherent in your industry. But you do have some level of control.</p><p class="p2">If you enter a market like payment processing, be prepared for the long-haul. You&rsquo;ll likely struggle to establish your credibility early-on, and finding innovative ways to acquire new customers be vital. You&rsquo;ll need to raise significant amounts of early capital to invest in infrastructure that will only start to pay off years later.</p><p class="p2">If you&rsquo;re part of an industry in which you can acquire customers incredibly cheaply and monetise them quickly, you&rsquo;ll generally need less early capital. You&rsquo;ll often reach profitability very early on, and it may feel like you&rsquo;re on a startup rocket-ship. But make sure you&rsquo;re providing sustainable, long-term value to your customers, otherwise you risk running out of fuel and crashing painfully back to earth.</p><p><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D8015917&amp;t=YzhlN2NlYTA4NzM5NWI2N2UzZDdkNDZhZDg1YzNkNDMwZWJkOWQ2OSxPNkVtNVN4cQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F81105143223%2Fcustomer-churn-can-kill-your-startup&amp;m=1">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a></p></div>

      <div class="text"><p><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdilbert.com%2Fstrips%2Fcomic%2F2000-05-21&amp;t=ZTg4YmRlODBjYjEwYTFlOTZmNDVkYzdlMzM2OGFhOTQzNjI5N2M1YSxMZjZRTWV3eA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62619282797%2Fstartup-series-part-4-deadlines&amp;m=1"><img alt="image" src="http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/00000/6000/300/6379/6379.strip.sunday.gif"></a></p><p>The question of deadlines is one of the most divisive issues in software development today. Business-people despair at developers&rsquo; inability to meet goals, while developers lament the latest unachievable deadline imposed by their pointy-haired boss.</p><p>In practice, there is often a common cause of this malaise. If your team doesn&rsquo;t have an agreed scope with sufficiently granular time-estimates for each component piece of work, your project will inevitably overrun, and sometimes by an order of magnitude.</p><p><strong>Scoping a project</strong></p><p>The solution is to come up with a scoped deadline - a date in the future by which you will have implemented an agreed list of features or functionality. Crucially, each of the features needs an estimate of the amount of time or effort required to complete it, similar to some styles of <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAgile_software_development&amp;t=MGZmYzRhMDMzMDgzYzAxODRiMTRhMTRiYTFhNWZjYTAwNWNiOGI3OCxMZjZRTWV3eA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62619282797%2Fstartup-series-part-4-deadlines&amp;m=1">Agile software development</a>.</p><p>The only effective way to estimate effort is to break the project down into chunks of work that can individually be estimated. In no case should any chunk be more than 2 developer-days, and ideally they&rsquo;d be around &frac12; a day each (4 hours). There are lots of methods for actually coming up with these numbers - <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPlanning_poker&amp;t=NDNkYWJjN2ZiNjVhNzQzOTdjMDQ4Yjk4MTFhZjcwYTJlMDdiMzEwMSxMZjZRTWV3eA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62619282797%2Fstartup-series-part-4-deadlines&amp;m=1">Planning poker</a> is one neat collaborative solution, or Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joelonsoftware.com%2Fitems%2F2007%2F10%2F26.html&amp;t=MDM3MThkZmJjMTI1MGY2NjlhYjU0NGY5ZWI0ZGJjZWZmNzQ5ZjU3ZixMZjZRTWV3eA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62619282797%2Fstartup-series-part-4-deadlines&amp;m=1">Evidence-Based Estimation</a> is also interesting.</p><p>Fundamentally, developers should be the people saying how long a given chunk of work will take. Whatever system you use, it&rsquo;s essential to have a relationship where developers feel like their judgment is respected and the business-side of the company trusts developers to put in a reasonable amount of effort. At the end of the day, even the best estimation techniques can&rsquo;t fix a broken culture.</p><p>The alternative, an &ldquo;it&rsquo;s done when it&rsquo;s done&rdquo; attitude, is dangerously counterproductive - if there&rsquo;s no pressure to hit business goals, technical decisions will tend towards feature-creep and perfectionism.</p><p><strong>Why scoped-deadlines are useful</strong></p><p>As far as I can see, there are 3 main benefits of scoped deadlines:</p><p>It makes you iterative - forcing everyone involved to ask &ldquo;is this feature really necessary?&rdquo;. You will always have more development work than time available, so choosing what to work on is a crucial skill. If you strive to keep your deadlines around 2 weeks, you will prototype very quickly, building only the features you really need. Half the time, customer feedback will change what you saw as &ldquo;version 2&rdquo; anyway.</p><p>Second, it prevents scope creep during the project, as you&rsquo;ve locked-in the features that are going to be delivered. This is good for both developers and business-people. For the former, it encourages a &nbsp;pragmatic approach to the quality-vs-speed tradeoff - personally, it helps me check the urge to refactor code when it isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary. For the latter, it provides a positive response to the perennial request of &ldquo;can you just implement XYZ for me?&rdquo;. Sure - in the next version.</p><p>Third, it can sometimes good for motivation &amp; productivity, for some combination of people, teams &amp; problems. I find deadlines energising - crossing to-do items of a list, and delivering impressive new feature motivates me. It&rsquo;s a very tangible way for a team to see that they&rsquo;re making progress, and people love being part of success. But it&rsquo;s certainly the least important of the three.</p><p><strong>Deadlines in practice</strong></p><p>As a project progresses, you should be regularly deploying your code - use a feature-switch to keep new work visible to only staff or small segments of your user base. This is very important because it&rsquo;s a leading indicator of missed deadlines. If you&rsquo;re halfway through your &ldquo;sprint&rdquo;, and no code has been deployed, you&rsquo;re likely going to overrun. It also helps catch bugs early, and makes you consider how your code will interact with the existing codebase from the very start.</p><p>Even with this advice, you sometimes just won&rsquo;t hit your deadlines. It might turn out that the version on open-source library you&rsquo;re using isn&rsquo;t compatible with a new tool you want to implement. Unexpected problems crop up. While I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a terrible thing to work a couple of late nights if your project needs to get back on track, it&rsquo;s very different if the scope of the project has fundamentally changed.</p><p>Retrospectives are a good way to identify any patterns in scoping problems - if you highlight areas that consistently overran, you&rsquo;ll get better at spotting them in future.</p><p>On the other hand, be quick to celebrate your successes. Releasing code from behind a feature-switch to your general user-base is a great time to gather the team and reflect on your achievements.</p><p>Discuss this post over at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D6514572&amp;t=YTc0MjNhZGNhODdmZWU5MTllM2M4ZjIxMGZkN2VkZjdiMTNjYjk2MixMZjZRTWV3eA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62619282797%2Fstartup-series-part-4-deadlines&amp;m=1">Hacker News</a></p></div>

      <h3><span>Startup Series Part 3: You make what you measure</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><blockquote><p class="p1">Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users. You&rsquo;ll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you&rsquo;ll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you&rsquo;ll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure.</p><p class="p1"><em>- Paul Graham</em></p></blockquote><p class="p1">Metrics are one of the most powerful and most dangerous tools at a startup&rsquo;s disposal. They can help focus a team around a common goal or push you off-course for months.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Start by tracking one thing</strong></p><p class="p1">We realised pretty early at GoCardless that we needed to track&nbsp;something&nbsp;to work out if we were improving. As we are a payments processor, the first metric we chose was our total daily transaction value - how much money was going through the system. We chose this metric because, in the very early days, total daily transaction fees (ie our revenue) was embarrassingly low, whereas our total transactions were roughly 100x higher. This worked well for a few months - we hit milestones in encouragingly quick succession, moving from &pound;1k-a-month to &pound;1m-a-month to &pound;1m-a-day. We&rsquo;d display the daily number on a large board in the office, and send weekly and monthly summaries to everyone in the company, with the change over the previous period. It worked well both to motivate the team and act as a Pole Star when making decisions; &ldquo;which of these options will maximise our monthly transaction value?&rdquo;. When we hit&nbsp;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Fgrowth.html&amp;t=OGM5YjM2ZTE1YWNlYTRkZTEwNDczNzM1NzgzMTlhNmFjYmFlMmRjNSw5ZHM1S2g4Wg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62342949294%2Fstartup-series-part-3-you-make-what-you-measure&amp;m=1"><span class="s1">10% week-on-week growth</span></a>, we were happy. When we didn&rsquo;t, we redoubled our efforts.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Choose a proxy for long-term value</strong></p><p class="p1">However, a year or so down the line, we realised that we&rsquo;d encouraged some pretty perverse behaviour. A large minority of our transaction value was coming from a few merchants putting through very high-value transactions. Because of a quirk in our pricing model (1% capped at &pound;2 per transaction), we were actually making relatively little revenue and assuming way more risk than we&rsquo;d like on these customers. For a short time, we were actively pursuing more of these customers in order to boost transaction value. Yet, when we came to search for a solution, it was incredible how ingrained our hunt for transaction volume had become - any change we made to combat the problem would inevitably result in lower transaction values, although dramatically higher revenue - and yet, emotionally, we struggled to make the change.&nbsp;Once we swapped the key metric to daily transaction fees, the problem went away.</p><p class="p1">Since it sometimes seems fashionable to run companies without revenue, you need to pick the best proxy for long-term value of your company, be that profit, revenue, installs, MAU or page-views. But this raises the next problem we encountered. Even if you could track company value on a day-to-day basis (and you can if you&rsquo;ve gone public), it&rsquo;s not an&nbsp;actionable&nbsp;metric. This is usually a problem for B2B companies since the enterprise sales cycle can often be several months - the work you do today won&rsquo;t impact revenue for some time.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Break out KPIs</strong></p><p class="p1">One solution is to have each team within the company break down that key number into its component drivers until you get to something actionable. A really neat example is an outbound telesales team. Ultimately, you want your sales team to be closing recurring deals, which will drive revenue in a predictable fashion. But, as any sales director will tell you, if you&rsquo;re not closing the deals, you need to focus on the activities you&rsquo;re performing. The stage before a closed deal might be some form of proposal, outlining the key SLAs you will deliver in return for committed fees. To deliver 5 closed deals this month, you might need to make 10 proposals. To make those 10 proposals, you need to attend pitch meetings with 20 companies. To get those pitch meetings, you&rsquo;ll need to have spoken to 200 companies. Since only 1-in-3 cold-calls results in a conversation with a decision-maker, your telesales teams need to call 600 companies this month. Suddenly, you have some pretty actionable KPIs for your sales team. These are the numbers that you track in daily stand-ups, and measure conversion between each stage. Since they are&nbsp;actionable&nbsp;metrics, the entire process becomes an optimisation problem.</p><p class="p1">As far as possible, each part of your business should have 2 or 3 actionable metrics that they examine on a daily or weekly basis. They&rsquo;re the numbers that tell you whether you&rsquo;re improving or not. An example might be website up-time for the devops team, or average customer wait-time for your customer support team. Whatever numbers you choose need to be objective - if people can massage up a bad month, it undermines everyone&rsquo;s faith in the metric. These metrics shouldn&rsquo;t be sticks to beat people with - it&rsquo;s actually incredibly motivating to work very hard and see that you&rsquo;re making progress. They&rsquo;re also useful to highlight strategies or areas of the business that just aren&rsquo;t working out, rather than allocating personal blame.</p><p class="p1">Eric Ries spends a lot of time in the&nbsp;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThe-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous%2Fdp%2F0307887898&amp;t=MmJhZDBiOTE0ZTBiYTU3YzlhOTRiNzliNWI3NjdkNTVhZDM2YmQzZCw5ZHM1S2g4Wg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62342949294%2Fstartup-series-part-3-you-make-what-you-measure&amp;m=1">Lean Startup</a>&nbsp;talking about <em>actionable</em> vs <em>vanity</em> metrics - it&rsquo;s well worth a read.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Implement your strategy with KPIs</strong></p><p class="p1">The choice of KPIs is also a very powerful tool for a founder or management team to set the direction of a company. There are many different ways to reach &pound;1m in monthly revenue - the way you set up your KPIs and associated targets will have a huge influence over the behaviour of people in your company. As a simple example, are you aiming for 10,000 customers to pay you &pound;100 each, or 100 who&rsquo;ll pay &pound;10,000 each?</p><p class="p1"><strong>When metrics go wrong</strong></p><p class="p1">Even these actionable KPIs can produce perverse behaviour. I worked at a large national utilities supplier whose (very large) email customer service team committed to responding to 90% of emails within 24 hours. On the face of it, a great actionable metric - and the team were consistently replying to 89 or 90% of emails within the&nbsp;allotted&nbsp;time. But they&rsquo;d also developed a practice of simply ignoring any email which exceed the 24-hour cutoff. Since these emails didn&rsquo;t impact their targets (or their bonus), 10% of customers simply never got a response.</p><p class="p1">A final issue is that, in some areas of your business, KPIs can be really tough or even impossible to pin down. While a front-end team working on your landing pages might measure conversion to signup, a PR team running a 6-month campaign may struggle to find an objective indicator of success. You can try to count the number of articles (and the readership of each), but you&rsquo;d also need to assess the relevancy of the target audience. You might try to establish a baseline of page-views and count increases or spikes, but there&rsquo;s so much noise that it quickly becomes subjective. While people have tried to to pin down the value of a &ldquo;like&rdquo; or a &ldquo;re-tweet&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s only usually relevant for consumer-facing companies. We&rsquo;ve never really managed to find a solution to this problem - I&rsquo;d love to hear what other companies have done.</p><p class="p1"><strong>In summary</strong></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">Pick one number that&rsquo;s your &ldquo;Pole star&rdquo; - the best proxy for long-term company value. Re-examine it periodically to see if it&rsquo;s producing perverse outcomes.</li><li class="li1">Have each team break down the key metric into its component drivers or KPIs that individuals can influence. Measure team &amp; individual performance &amp; improvement on this basis.</li><li class="li1">Make sure the numbers are objective.</li><li class="li1">Make them visible - put the key metric on a big dashboard, and give each team a dashboard that lets them see how they&rsquo;re doing. Send regular automated emails around your teams with a breakdown of their numbers.</li></ul><p>Follow the discussion over on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D6456353&amp;t=MWQzNTQ4ZDMyOWM2YzE5NTAzNzA2Zjg0MGFlMzEzOTAxMjBiYzE2Yyw5ZHM1S2g4Wg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F62342949294%2Fstartup-series-part-3-you-make-what-you-measure&amp;m=1">Hacker News</a></p></div>

      <h3><span>Startup Series Part 2: Attracting great engineers</span></h3>

      <div class="text"><p class="p1">This is the second in a series of articles on the operational side of running startup - once you&rsquo;ve found product-market fit and raised VC cash, how do you go about building a business?</p><p class="p1">The first post in this series, on the hiring process, assumes you have a sufficient number of quality applicants. Once that&rsquo;s true, hiring becomes a process optimisation problem - it might take a bit of effort to get right, but there aren&rsquo;t too many unknowns. On the other hand, attracting top-quality developers to your company in the first place is a much tougher proposition.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">In the long-term,&nbsp;you will attract outstanding talent if you;&nbsp;</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">build a successful company with a strong vision</li><li class="li1">working on interesting technical challenges</li><li class="li1">with other outstanding developers</li><li class="li1">who value software development as a professional trade.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class="p1">The often-omitted final step is to tell people about it! You could have the best culture in the world, but you won&rsquo;t attract applicants if no-one knows about you.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Github is one of the best in the business when it comes to attracting great talent. People like Zach Holman and Tom Preston-Warner blog profusely and tour the world talking about software development. But, underlying every article and presentation is this message; Github is an awesome place to work.</p><p class="p1">Since not every company can spend hundreds of thousands a year flying people around the world for conferences, or <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fshareables%2F2013%2F09%2F07%2Fgithubs-new-office-includes-a-replica-of-the-oval-office%2F&amp;t=YmFjYzMxNjNjNmIyZDE4OGVmOTIxZTQ4MTE0Mzc4YzIxNTY2YTQxNixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">fit their reception area out as a replica of the Oval Office</a>,&nbsp;<span>I wanted to share a few&nbsp;</span><span class="s2">actionable</span><span> tips for the first-time founder.&nbsp;These shorter-term fixes will provide value disproportionate to their cost. There are also a few gotchas - common practices that do more harm than good.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">Provide top-quality equipment</span></strong></p><p class="p1">Dollar-for-dollar, high-quality equipment was consistently the most sought-after perk when we&rsquo;ve surveyed developers, above a swanky office, fancy snacks, and even salary. It makes sense to invest here.</p><p class="p1">Some simple maths backs this up - depending on experience, you might pay anywhere from &pound;30,000 to &pound;70,000+ for a software developer in somewhere like London.&nbsp;Upgrading from a standard MacBook air to top-of the range model plus Thunderbolt display will cost you an additional &pound;1,500. You&rsquo;d need to achieve a 1.9% productivity gain (based on a &pound;40k salary and a 2-year equipment lifetime) to pay back the investment.&nbsp;If this equipment reduces the running time of your test-suite by two minutes, you&rsquo;d save about 4 days a year[1] &nbsp;which, alone, is worth about 1.8% productivity boost.</p><p class="p1">[1] 4 days = 2 minutes * 5 runs a day * 225 working days per year</p><p class="p1">It then costs, conservatively, &pound;5,000 to attract and hire a single developer. If top-quality equipment has any impact on hiring or retention, you&rsquo;ve suddenly made a profitable investment.&nbsp;You also get to take lots of cool photos of your working environment and post them all over twitter and your hiring page - remember that telling people is the most important part.</p><p class="p1"><img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/ddebec46b60f554989f09682fc3d8e71/tumblr_inline_mtj697fPI11r5tr1m.jpg"></p><p class="p2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span>Interesting observation; while we still let people choose their equipment, we strongly encourage people to choose between the MacBook Pro and Air. We&rsquo;ve had several people originally opt for various flavours of Linux, but they&rsquo;ve all swapped over to Macs within 12 months. The homogeneity means that equipment will work anywhere in the office - swapping desks to work with a new project team simply means plugging into a new Thunderbolt, rather than lugging tonnes of equipment around. It also means that useful internal tools &amp; scripts that we&rsquo;ve developed are more likely to work out-of-the-box.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">Work on awesome side-projects</span></strong></p><p class="p1">We&rsquo;ve found that&nbsp;having the engineering team take a couple of days off work to hack on a fun side-project can be a great recruitment tool.&nbsp;Not only does it increase morale and let you try out new technologies, it also provides you with great content for blogging &amp; conference talks.</p><p class="p1">The best example is our <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgocardless.com%2Fblog%2Fhacking-on-side-projects-the-pool-ball-tracker%2F&amp;t=NTdjOTFiYjBhN2QzNmY0NzMwMjc4ZTQ1NjcwMDRmZjM3MDgwNTI5YixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">pool-ball tracker</a> we built at GoCardless. We mounted a webcam above our office pool table, and used OpenCV libraries to track the position of the balls. The ball coordinates were fed into a rules engine which then scored the game. It got a great reception on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D4717196&amp;t=ZGU4MmQ1YjU1ZWJjZDk1NTFjMmZmMzdjN2I1Y2YzMDMzMDlmOGFkNixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">Hacker News</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere, and resulted in an extra 9,000 unique visitors to our site on a single day. And it was awesome fun.</p><p class="p1">Other examples are our GoCardless-branded beer and <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgocardless.com%2Fblog%2Fraspberry-pi-metric-dashboards%2F&amp;t=MTU5YjE1MTU3YjA2M2FmNGVmNDY0YTVmNzRjMWUzNTRiYTAxYTFlYSxmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">Raspberry Pi</a><span>&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">Our only failure here was a Spotify-powered office music system - we just never got around to blogging about it. As with everything on this list, it&rsquo;s only effective if you tell people about it.</p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">Technical &amp; Culture Blogging</span></strong></p><p class="p1">This is the single greatest recruitment tool we&rsquo;ve found. If you&rsquo;re using any kind of technology at all, or have views on development best-practices and startup culture, you should be able to write compelling content that will do well on places like Hacker News and Reddit. It&rsquo;s also more more repeatable and has a higher ROI than side-projects, because it doesn&rsquo;t require half-a-dozen people to take multiple days off work.</p><p class="p1">For example, one particularly incendiary article on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgocardless.com%2Fblog%2Funresponsive-design%2F&amp;t=NTFmN2FiOGQ4YjIzMjdmODlmYWI2YjMzNmYyZDM5YmEzNTE1M2JmMixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">ditching Responsive Web Design</a><span>&nbsp;garnered 34,000 unique visitors on a single day. We&rsquo;ve had several applicants explicitly mention this article during interviews, even 9 months down the line.</span></p><p class="p1">You can blog about pretty much anything you work on - meetings, org structure, a <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgocardless.com%2Fblog%2Fbuilding-a-large-angular-application%2F&amp;t=NjExOTljMzg0YmFhNTJlNTMxNTUwMTE3OTE1ZjcxYjU0MzU1NGNkZixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">new javascript framework</a>&nbsp;you&rsquo;re using. Explaining how you&rsquo;re different from just another BigCo is an extremely useful recruitment tool.</p><p class="p1">Often, the key to getting traction on somewhere like Hacker News is choosing a punchy title and taking a slightly more extreme position (See <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fzachholman.com%2Fposts%2Fhow-github-works-hours%2F&amp;t=MzUyYjkxNTgwMjU3MzBlM2Y0OTJkMjVkMTBiMTRmYWY3MzdkOGRhZixmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">&ldquo;Hours are Bullshit&rdquo;</a>) that you might otherwise do. Interesting technical posts do well, too.</p><p class="p1">From a practical point of view, make sure you host the blog on your company&rsquo;s domain (SEO benefits), mention your company&rsquo;s name and link to your hiring page in an inoffensive way.</p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">Open-source your tools</span></strong></p><p class="p1">As a technology startup, you&rsquo;ll be successful if you&rsquo;re closer to your market &amp; customers than your competitors, and you&rsquo;re able to respond more quickly to their needs. As such, giving away tools that make you more productive initially seems counter-intuitive, but it&rsquo;s not. Depending on your market, your competitors are likely to be slow-moving incumbents. If they&rsquo;re still struggling with Visual Basic .Net and SOAP APIs, releasing a new Ruby deployment tool isn&rsquo;t going to help them much.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Even if that&rsquo;s not the case, open-sourcing useful little tools will dramatically help your recruitment processes - Github are the authors of the well-known Ruby tool&nbsp;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fblog%2F542-introducing-resque&amp;t=ODdiMTQzNGFiN2Y2OGFhYWFiYTlkYTAyYWUyMDk0MmYxMDlmNzJkMSxmZW5QcGltZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61958629156%2Fstartup-series-part-2-attracting-great-engineers&amp;m=1">Resque</a>, for example.</p><p class="p1">At GoCardless, we&rsquo;ve not been as good as we&rsquo;d like at open-sourcing our tools, but that&rsquo;s changing.

This is a positive thing for the ecosystem - just as new software tools mean it&rsquo;s simpler and cheaper to start a company, these methodologies allow first-time entrepreneurs to avoid many of the pitfalls of the past.</span></p><p>But I&rsquo;d like to write a more practical guide - what happens once you&rsquo;ve launched your MVP, iterated to a product that people actually want, and raised VC money to scale? What are the day-to-day challenges you&rsquo;ll face and pitfalls you&rsquo;ll encounter? Over the last 3 years at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgocardless.com&amp;t=MGVjYTk2YmY3YTliYTcxMDIzMzE3OTg4OTNiYmIxYzJiY2Y1ZjRiYixRc3RPNkx2UA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61760552398%2Fstartup-series-part-1-interviewing-engineers&amp;m=1">GoCardless</a>, we&rsquo;ve run into and subsequently dug ourselves out of many of these pitfalls. By making these mistakes, we&rsquo;ve developed solutions that, at times, have dramatically increased our productivity.</p><p><span><span><br><span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>Startup Series Part 1: Interviewing Engineers</strong></p><p><span>The hiring process at technology companies has been the subject of a great number of blog posts, often written from the perspective of disgruntled candidates. They rail against what they see as capricious and ineffective techniques. This problem will probably exist as long as interviews produce&nbsp;unsuccessful&nbsp;candidates, but it is possible to design &amp; run a process that will annoy a very minimal number of people, whilst selecting the best of the bunch to work at your company.</span></p><p><span>Once you have a good number of capable people applying to work at your company (a much harder problem!), selecting the best of them should not be a terribly difficult problem.</span></p><p><span>Over the last 3 years, we&rsquo;ve seen around a thousand CVs, conducted hundreds of interviews, reviewed several dozen coding challenges and ultimately made 15 technical hires. As a result, we identified a number pitfalls in the interviewing and selection process. Usually we did this by stumbling into them head-first.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Define a process and stick to it</span></strong></p><p><span>If you&rsquo;re not absolutely clear on what each step of the interview process involves, and what you&rsquo;re looking for at each stage, you&rsquo;ll inevitably resort to weak, fluffy questions that don&rsquo;t really reveal anything about candidate. If you throw a couple of your developers into an interview with no preparation, you&rsquo;ve wasted 2 hours of engineering time at best. At worst, you&rsquo;ve alienated the candidate and irritated your developers.</span></p><p><span>Instead, invest a little time defining what systems and processes you&rsquo;ll use. Write down this process and share it with your team and candidates. You don&rsquo;t need to invent this from scratch - choose someone else&rsquo;s and adapt it to your needs.</span></p><p><span>Get an applicant-tracking system that stores CVs and the result of each interview (with detailed notes), so that you can compare candidates based on data. If you see a dozen developers in a week day, you&rsquo;re unlikely to remember each of them by Friday.</span></p><p><span>Our process was pretty simple: CV screen, 15-minute phone screen, 2-hour coding exercise, 1 in-person interview to debrief on the coding exercise, 2 subsequent &ldquo;final-round&rdquo; interviews, with a mix of technical and &ldquo;fit&rdquo; questions.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately, the output of each stage should be &ldquo;hire&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-hire&rdquo;. Rack up enough &ldquo;hire&rdquo; votes from the different interviews, and you can make an informed decision. If you want, you can assign a more granular score, but it rarely yields a different outcome.</span></p><p><span><span>If you find yourself coming out of an interview and not being able to offer a hire/no-hire opinion, you&rsquo;re asking the wrong questions.<span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><strong>Lack of preparation is unforgivable</strong></p><p><span>Before the interview, write a list of good questions for each aspect of a developer&rsquo;s skillset - with a backend developer, for example, you might want to focus on &ldquo;web technology&rdquo;, &ldquo;databases&rdquo;, &ldquo;system design and architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;algorithms&rdquo;. If you have 2 in-person interviews, split the topics between them so that you don&rsquo;t end up covering the same ground.</span></p><p><span>You can do the same thing for cultural &amp; personality interviews, but you need to take care to avoid weak questions which either don&rsquo;t reveal anything. Often, questions like &ldquo;why do you want to work at a startup?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why do you want to work at this company?&rdquo; are just an opportunity for the candidate to blow smoke up your arse. It&rsquo;s a vanity exercise.</span></p><p><span>Instead, I like questions like &ldquo;which parts of your previous job did you most enjoy? Which parts would you avoid in future?&rdquo;. If you really probe for specific examples, it can tell you a lot about a person&rsquo;s personality and motivations.</span></p><p><span>This list of questions should be shared with the company, and improved over time. I&rsquo;d suggest it&rsquo;s a key part of the company&rsquo;s IP.</span></p><p><span><span><br><span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>Relevant coding challenges are the best indicator of ability</strong></p><p><span>In my experience, relevant, realistic coding challenges are by far the best indicator of ability. They should take roughly 2 hours, to be done in the candidate&rsquo;s own time, and they should tell you:</span></p><p><span>- at a basic level, can the candidate structure a simple system?</span></p><p><span>- does the candidate write fluent, idiomatic code, in the context of whatever language is chosen?</span></p><p><span>- can the candidate select &amp; use appropriate libraries?</span></p><p><span>- how much effort has gone into building the system?</span></p><p><span>For example, we sometimes ask people to write a client library for a real-world API or web-service in a language of their choice. I really like the exercise because there are such a range of solutions and opportunities for people to demonstrate exceptional ability and effort. There are also a number of great extension questions when you ask the candidate to talk you through the solution. How would you speed-up the client or the API? What are the different approaches to caching? How might you fetch a great number records simultaneously? If you were maintaining the API, how would you deal with very high volumes of requests? What are the various ways of dealing with API versioning?</span></p><p><span>We also tend to do some fairly lightweight algorithmic coding challenges in person - calculate row n of Pascal&rsquo;s triangle or implement a basic sorting algorithm, for example. It&rsquo;s important to provide a clear definition of the algorithm in question, allow the candidate use of a language of their choice and their own development environment, otherwise you&rsquo;re not testing the right things. Interestingly, the optimal solution to many of these challenges involve recursion - a technique that seems to baffle some developers.</span></p><p><span> These shorter tests tend to reveal whether people can think under pressure, communicate clearly and debug broken code in a sensible way. For example, faced with a half-working sorting algorithm, a bad candidate will start changing variables at random. A good candidate would work methodically through the problem, ideally adding debugging lines that output the values of relevant variables at each stage. It&rsquo;s worth noting that, while useful, these tests are not as good an indicator of on-the-job capability as the longer coding challenge. Many fantastic engineers don&rsquo;t excel under this kind of high-pressure situation, and actually it&rsquo;s not the kind of scenario they&rsquo;d encounter on-the-job very often.</span></p><p><span>At the other end of the spectrum, asking someone to complete a 3 or 4-day project might be the ideal way to judge aptitude, but it just isn&rsquo;t realistic in our experience.</span></p><p><strong>Practical Tips</strong></p><p><span>Finally, there are a number of simple practical tips that will make your life much easier:</span></p><p><span>Wherever possible, try to bunch your interviews into blocks of time. At the most extreme, I met 8 applicants for in-person interviews in a single day. It&rsquo;s exhausting, but it avoids constant distraction and context-switching, and allows you compare candidates more effectively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Have one person in the company who is responsible for receiving &amp; screening CVs. Do this in blocks of time, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it can get overwhelming&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Be clear what you&rsquo;re looking for from CV- and phone-screens. You could be&nbsp;wasting&nbsp;a lot of time. Write a checklist after you&rsquo;ve seen a dozen or two CVs. We should have rejected way more people at this stage.</span></p><p><span>Whatever the outcome, respond to candidates quickly and constructively. It makes them feel valued, and it&rsquo;s simple good manners.</span></p><p><strong>Finally&hellip;</strong></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-11093689-3bd9-0bd7-d13f-44cf836a1c59"><span></span><span>Even using this process, you&rsquo;ll make bad hires. It happens, and it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. Fire fast and move on. Overwhelmingly, the bad hires we made were due to poor preparation, or, at times, wilfully skipping most of this process. Hiring well is one of the most important things you can do for your company. Don&rsquo;t neglect it!</span></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts - please comment below, or follow the discussion over at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D6430088&amp;t=MmFiNGM0ZmFkMjdlNWZkYjhiNmFjMTA1MDQwY2VhMjVmMGQ5OGY5NSxRc3RPNkx2UA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AXgZ3424Wrwxd8Lf0H8QVFw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftomblomfield.com%2Fpost%2F61760552398%2Fstartup-series-part-1-interviewing-engineers&amp;m=1">Hacker News</a></span></p></div>
